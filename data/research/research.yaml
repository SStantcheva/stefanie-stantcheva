- title: "Short-time work and its effect on employment and firm survival: evidence from the Great Recession in Belgium"
  coauthors: "Bart Cockx"
  abstract: > 
  Short-time work is a public insurance program that allows employers to temporarily reduce employees working hours without terminating the employee-employer relationship, while providing a subsidy that partially compensates employees for the loss of income. During the global financial crisis, many European countries reintroduced or modified STW schemes, with Belgium being no exception and having the highest uptake in Europe. Given the program's significant public expenditure implications, it is crucial to investigate its short- and medium-run effects on employment and firm survival. We use detailed administrative data and employ an instrumental variable first difference estimator that exploits exogeneous variation using an institutional feature of the Belgian scheme. Our findings are consistent with previous evidence, indicating that STW is effective in preserving jobs in the short run but results in a reduction in total hours per firm, suggesting the possibility of deadweight losses at recession peaks. 

- title: "Hiring subsidies and temporary work agencies" 
  coauthors: "Sam Desiere"
  abstract: > 
  This paper evaluates a hiring subsidy for lower-educated youth in Flanders, Belgium. In contrast to most studies, we do not find positive employment effects of the hiring subsidy on eligible job seekers. We offer a novel explanation for this null finding. We first document that roughly 40% of the subsidised jobs were temporary work agency jobs. We then show that these agencies did not respond to the policy and employed fewer eligible individuals after the reform. Our findings highlight the role of temporary work agencies in shaping the effectiveness of policies targeted at disadvantaged groups.

- title: "Firm outcomes adjustment in response to changes in the corporate income tax rate in Developing Countries: Evidence from Ecuador 2013 - 2019" 
  coauthors: "William Parienté (supervisor of Master Thesis)"
  abstract: > 
  The low tax capacity is an important issue in many developing and emerging countries. Most governments have tackled this issue by implementing fiscal reforms that comprise changes in tax rates, improvements in administrative enforcement or even both at the same time. I use a quasi experimental setting created as a result of a fiscal reform in Ecuador in late 2014. Using a panel of administrative data from firms financial statements during the period 2013-2018, I exploit the variation created by the reform that consisted in an increase from 22% to 25% - in 2015 - and to 28% - in 2018 - on the statutory corporate income tax rate. Three types of responses are studied: 1) corporate size responses, 2) financing responses, 3) profit shifting responses and 4) changes in ownership structure after the reform. Even though there is a large literature that has been built around firms behavior to changes in corporate tax rates in developed countries, there is ambiguos and scarced evidence about the responses of firms to fiscal reforms in developing and emerging countries.

    Following massive take-up rates during the COVID-19 period, short-time work (STW) policies have attracted renewed interest. In this paper, we take stock of this policy instrument and provide a critical review of STW systems in Europe. We focus on the objectives of STW programs and their primary characteristics, as well as the inefficiencies associated with these policies, such as excessive use and slower worker reallocation. Additionally, we take a stroll through the main contributions of STW impact evaluations. Finally, we identify relevant directions for the refinement of the main design features of the scheme, key lessons, and avenues for future research.

  abstract: >
    Tax reforms involve welfare changes that need to be consistently measured. Pivotal parameter in such empirical efforts is the Elasticity of Taxable Income (ETI). This paper contributes to the estimation of the ETI in developing economies. We rely on a research design based on Ecuador's Reformatory Law of Tax Equity of 2007. By using personal income tax administrative records, we show that, on average, the ETI (net-of-MTR) of the aggregated gross income is around -0.23. Also, we find evidence of heterogeneous responses to tax policy shocks through changes in Marginal Tax Rates, conditional on income levels; a one percentage point increase in the MTR leads to an increase of 0.15 percentage points of the aggregated gross income in lower-income taxpayers, while for higher-income taxpayers we report a null effect. Results are robust to different specifications and adjustments proposed due to parallel changes in deduction policies.

    In developing countries, the evidence regarding the direct and indirect effects of FDI on economic and financial performance at the firm level is mixed. To contribute to this literature, we provide empirical evidence of direct and indirect effects of FDI on firm’s performance, using return on assets (ROA), gross revenues and gross revenues growth rate as performance measures. We examine the private formal enterprise sector in Ecuador from 2007 to 2018. Our identification strategy relies on the use of the Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) methodology for dynamic panel data which allows us to control for potential endogeneity, autocorrelation and heteroskedasticity issues. The results suggest that firms with inward FDI grow faster than their counterparts, and firms with higher amounts of FDI as a share of total revenues have on average higher levels of gross revenues. Moreover, we find negative horizontal wages and gross revenues spillover effects on gross revenues growth rates, but positive horizontal gross revenues spillover effects on ROA. There is also significant evidence of negative horizontal spillover effects in all economic sectors, whereas evidence for forward and backward spillovers is heterogeneous across them.

  The construction sector is one of the most important sectors for economic development due, among other reasons, to the productive chains that it generates. This paper presents an analysis of the determinants of the total factor productivity (TFP) in the Ecuadorian construction sector during the period 2007–2018. In the first stage, we estimate a production function using the Wooldridge (Economics Letters, 2009, 104, 112–114) estimator to correct the simultaneous determination of inputs and firm unobserved productivity. In the second stage, we analyze the main determinants of TFP. These determinants are classified into four groups: internal, international trade, financial constraints, and external characteristics. Our results suggest that firm age is positively related with TFP but negatively related with TFP growth. Similarly, the fact of being a family firm is negatively related with TFP, but size is positively related with TFP and its growth across the construction subsectors. In addition, we find that access to debt and credit is positively related with productivity, but less-competitive environment is negatively related with productivity. Finally, our results suggest that TFP and its growth are pro-cyclical with respect to the gross domestic product. Our results have several managerial implications that are discussed in this article.

    The purpose of this paper is is to identify the main determinants of insurance profitability on life and non-life segments to obtain which variables affect in each market of the Ecuadorian insurance sector. Using a large panel data set with financial information from 2001 to 2017 we estimate the determinants through a panel corrected standard errors regression. We find that net premiums, technical reserves, capital ratio and score efficiency are micro-determinants in the life insurance sector, whereas in the non-life sector, the micro-determinants include also claim levels and liquidity ratios; moreover, we find that HHI is a determinant of profitability only in the life insurance sector. Among the macro determinants set, we find that the interest rate has also a significant impact both in the life and non-life insurance segments.
