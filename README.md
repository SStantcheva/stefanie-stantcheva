# Lei Yang's Homepage

This repository holds the source of [my homepage](http://leiy.me). The Hugo
theme used in the site can be found
[here](https://github.com/yangl1996/academimal).

## How to build your own

Like my homepage? Thanks! Would like to build your own? Then __please, do not
just copy the master branch.__ Instead, _understand how
[Hugo](https://gohugo.io/documentation/) works_ and _only use
this repository as an example for your own site._ Thank you!
