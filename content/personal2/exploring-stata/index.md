## Exploring Stata

I find the Ray and Maria Stata Center quite exciting to me. Besides the
exterior, the inner space has much to explore. I'll note down my findings
as a newcomer here on this page.

### Kitchens

My office is on G9, but sometimes I go to the kitchens of other floors for
drinks. Here's a list of kitchens that I have explored

- G9: An espresso machine and a bean grinder. Not super tidy since people tend to grind more than they need, and coffee powder end up on the table.
- G8: A capsule coffee machine with an abundance of cream and sweetener. Plus tea bags, Swiss Miss, and a hot water machine.

### Free Food

G9 free food calendar:

- Tuesday: PDOS, Database
- Wednesday: Faculty lunch (usually a lot of leftover)
- Friday: NMS

### Bathrooms

In the G-Tower (at least floor 8 and 9), the size of bathrooms is
unbalanced. For instance, G9 has a very small men's room and a large
women's room, and vice versa for G8. It should be easier to walk up or down
the stairs to the next floor (there are two stairs in the G-Tower)
than waiting.

### Vending Machines

There are several vending machines in the basement. To find them, go down
the stairs next to room 155 to B floor, and you'll encounter a sign saying "Do
not forget your MIT ID" (actually ID is not needed to return - there is no
prox card lock). Behind the door on the left, there are three
machines for icecream, soda and snacks. The door on the right leads to the
[tunnels]({{< relref "/personal/mit-tunnel-system" >}}) and there are four
machines for coffee, drinks and snacks. They all accept credit card, but no
TechCash.

### Connection to RLE

There is a connection to RLE (building 36) on the fourth floor. Just walk
through the Faculty Dining and past the elevators. Through this you
can access most buildings on the main campus without getting exposed to
the elements, or detouring through the basement tunnels.
