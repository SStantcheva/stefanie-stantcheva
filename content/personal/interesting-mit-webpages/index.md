## Interesting MIT Webpages

- [Space Accounting](https://floorplans.mit.edu/docs-any/wbid.html)
    - How buildings and rooms are numbered.
- [How to Get Around MIT](http://web.mit.edu/21w785/F98/HTG/mit.html)
    - Looks like the website was built in 1998 (inferred from the URL).
- [XVM for MIT](http://xvm.mit.edu)
    - Virtual servers for free.
- [CSAIL Olympics: The Movies](http://projects.csail.mit.edu/olympics/movies/)
    - Archive of the CSAIL Olympics movie-making competition.
- [CSAIL New Students Page](https://www.csail.mit.edu/newstudents)
    - I, as a new student, found it pretty useful
