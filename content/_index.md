## Hello!

I am the Nathaniel Ropes Professor of Political Economy at Harvard and founder of the [Social Economics Lab](http://socialeconomicslab.org/).

I study the **taxation** of firms and individuals, as well as **how people understand, perceive, and form their attitudes** towards public policies. My work has centered around the **long-lasting effects** of tax policy -- on innovation, education, and wealth. Recently, I have studied how R&D policies can be improved to **foster innovation**, how income and corporate taxes have shaped innovation over the 20th century, and how student loans can be structured to improve access to education. I have also explored people’s attitudes towards taxation, health care, immigration policies, environmental policies, and social mobility using **large-scale Social Economics Surveys and Experiments**.


I received my Ph.D. in Economics from MIT in 2014 and was a junior fellow at the Harvard Society of Fellows 2014-2016 before joining the Harvard Department of Economics in July 2016. I am currently co-editor of the Quarterly Journal of Economics.

This study highlights how people understand and reason about trade, and what factors shape their views on trade policy. The surveys aim to elicit respondents’ knowledge and understanding of trade, their perceived economic gains and distributional impacts from it, and their views on trade restrictions and compensatory redistribution for those hurt by trade.

People’s understanding of trade is imperfect and views are split on its efficiency and distributional effects. Respondents’ own exposure to trade through their sector, occupation, skill, or local labor market shape their perceptions of the impacts of trade on themselves, but also on others and on the broader U.S. economy.

<p>This paper illustrates the design and use of open-ended survey questions as a way of eliciting people's first-order concerns on policies. Multiple choice questions are the backbone of most surveys, but they may prime respondents to select answer options that they would not naturally have thought about, and they may omit relevant options. Open-ended questions that do not constrain respondents with specific answer choices are a valuable tool for eliciting first-order thinking. We discuss three text analysis methods to analyze open-ended questions' answers. To illustrate how to apply these methods, we provide evidence from large-scale surveys on income and estate taxation. We show the that key concerns relate mostly to distribution issues, fairness, and government, rather than to efficiency concerns. There are large partisan gaps in the first-order concerns on policies.</p>

Does immigration change support for redistribution? We design and conduct large-scale surveys and experiments in six countries to investigate how people perceive immigrants and how these perceptions influence their support for redistribution. We find striking misperceptions about the number and characteristics of immigrants. In all countries, respondents greatly overestimate the total number of immigrants. In the experimental part of our paper, we show that simply making respondents think about immigration before asking questions about redistribution makes them support less redistribution, including actual donations to charities.
