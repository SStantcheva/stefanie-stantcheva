### Hello and Welcome!

I am an economist studying the **taxation** of firms and individuals. I focus on three main issues:

1) The **long-run effects** of taxes on **innovation**, education & training, and wealth. How can we design the tax system to foster innovation?

2) The determinants of our **social preferences, attitudes, and perceptions**, which ultimately drive support for redistribution. To answer this, I conduct **large-scale online surveys** and experiments.

3) The effects of **taxes in imperfect markets** with informational frictions and rents.
