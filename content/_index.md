### About me

I'm a PhD student in Computer Science at the [Networks and Mobile Systems
Group](http://nms.csail.mit.edu) (<font face="Trebuchet MS"><b><font
color="#FF0000">N</font><font color="#009900">M</font><font
color="#3333FF">S</font></b></font>) of [MIT](http://web.mit.edu/)'s
[Computer Science & Artificial Intelligence Lab](https://www.csail.mit.edu)
(CSAIL). My research is focused on Computer Networks and Networked Systems.
I'm advised by [Prof. Mohammad Alizadeh](https://people.csail.mit.edu/alizadeh/)
and [Prof. Hari Balakrishnan](http://nms.csail.mit.edu/~hari/). Prior
to that, I received my B.S. in Computer Science at Peking University.

I love designing and building software and hardware systems that are robust,
performant, and easy to use. Previously I've done a bunch of projects in
wireless networking, such as a [camera](https://github.com/cjosephson/backcam)
system that runs for over a month on two AA batteries. My current research
focuses on improving the performance of blockchain. Our implementation of the
[Prism](https://github.com/yangl1996/prism-rust) protocol can support more than
70,000 transactions per second. Occasionally, I write about what I do in
[my blog](https://blog.leiy.me). When away from the keyboard, I enjoy hiking,
cycling, sailing and travelling. Plus, I am a licensed amateur radio operator.
My callsign is BH1UNB. Check out [my profile](https://www.qrz.com/db/BH1UNB)

### What's New

We put our paper _Prism: Scaling Bitcoin by 10,000x_ (authors: Lei Yang, Vivek Bagaria, Gerui Wang, Mohammad Alizadeh, David Tse, Giulia Fanti, Pramod Viswanath) on arXiv. Check out the [full text](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.11261) and the [source code](https://github.com/yangl1996/prism-rust)!
