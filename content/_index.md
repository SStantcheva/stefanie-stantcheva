## Hello!

I am the Nathaniel Ropes Professor of Political Economy at Harvard and founder of the [Social Economics Lab](http://socialeconomicslab.org/).

I study the **taxation** of firms and individuals, as well as **how people understand, perceive, and form their attitudes** towards public policies. My work has centered around the **long-lasting effects** of tax policy -- on innovation, education, and wealth. Recently, I have studied how R&D policies can be improved to **foster innovation**, how income and corporate taxes have shaped innovation over the 20th century, and how student loans can be structured to improve access to education. I have also explored people’s attitudes towards taxation, health care, immigration policies, environmental policies, and social mobility using **large-scale Social Economics Surveys and Experiments**.


I received my Ph.D. in Economics from MIT in 2014 and was a junior fellow at the Harvard Society of Fellows 2014-2016 before joining the Harvard Department of Economics in July 2016. I am currently co-editor of the Quarterly Journal of Economics. 

Here is my [Full CV](https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/stantcheva/files/cv_sstantcheva_jan2023b.pdf), and my [Research Summary](https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/stantcheva/files/econ_dynamic_2104.pdf).
