## Hello!

I am an economist studying the **taxation** of firms and individuals using models and data.

I explore the **long-run effects** of taxes on **innovation**, education & training, and wealth. How can we design the tax system to foster innovation?

I also run large-scale **"Social Economics Surveys and experiments"** to explore the determinants of our **social preferences, attitudes, and perceptions**.


I am a professor of Economics at Harvard University. 
Since May 2018, I have been a member of the French Council of Economic Advisers (Conseil d'Analyse Economique).  Since January 2020, I am a co-editor at the Quarterly Journal of Economics.

I received my Ph.D. in Economics from MIT in 2014 and was a junior fellow at the Harvard Society of Fellows 2014-2016 before joining the Harvard Department of Economics in July 2016.

Here is my [Full CV](https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/stantcheva/files/cv_sstantcheva_nov2019.pdf). Also: my [Research Statement](https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/stantcheva/files/stantcheva_research_statement_v1.pdf) and a short summary of my agenda on [Taxation and Innovation](https://www.nber.org/reporter/2018number3/stantcheva.html).
