## Hello!

I am the Nathaniel Ropes Professor of Political Economy at Harvard and founder and director of the [Social Economics Lab](http://socialeconomicslab.org/).

I study the **taxation** of firms and individuals, as well as **how people understand, perceive, and form their attitudes** towards economic issues and policies. My recent work explores people’s attitudes towards taxation, trade, immigration, climate change, and social mobility using **large-scale Social Economics Surveys and Experiments**. 

I have also studied the long-lasting effects of tax policy – on innovation, education, and wealth. Some examples include how R&D policies can be improved to foster innovation, how income and corporate taxes have shaped innovation over the 20th century, and how student loans can be structured to improve access to education. 

I am the recipient of the 2025 John Bates Clark Medal, awarded each year to an American economist under the age of forty who is judged to have made the most significant contribution to economic thought and knowledge, the 2020 Elaine Bennett Research Prize, a Sloan Foundation fellow, a Guggenheim fellow, and an Andrew Carnegie Fellow.

I received my Ph.D. in Economics from MIT in 2014 and was a junior fellow at the Harvard Society of Fellows 2014-2016 before joining the Harvard Department of Economics in July 2016. I am currently co-editor of the Quarterly Journal of Economics.
