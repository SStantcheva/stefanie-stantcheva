## Hello and welcome to my website!

I am an economist studying the **taxation** of firms and individuals. I focus on three main issues:

1) The **long-run effects** of taxes on **innovation**, education & training, and wealth. How can we design the tax system to foster innovation?

2) The determinants of our **social preferences, attitudes, and perceptions**, which ultimately drive support for redistribution. To answer this, I conduct **large-scale online surveys** and experiments.

3) The effects of **taxes in imperfect markets** with informational frictions and rents.

## A Brief Biography

Here is my [Research Statement](https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/stantcheva/files/stantcheva_research_statement_v1.pdf) and a short summary of my agenda on [Taxation and Innovation](https://www.nber.org/reporter/2018number3/stantcheva.html). Here is my [full CV](https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/stantcheva/files/cv_sstantcheva_nov2019.pdf).

I am a professor of Economics at Harvard University. My research focuses on how to improve the tax and transfer system for firms and individuals. I combine theory and empirics to study the effects of taxes and transfers on economic outcomes and how to incorporate these effects into our tax models.

Since May 2018, I have been a member of the French Council of Economic Advisers (Conseil d'Analyse Economique).  Starting January 2020, I will be co-editor at the Quarterly Journal of Economics.

I received my Ph.D. in Economics from MIT in 2014 and was a junior fellow at the Harvard Society of Fellows 2014-2016 before joining the Harvard Department of Economics in July 2016.
